    For a given direction :math:`i \\in [x, y, z]`, the grid spacing :math:`h_i`
    is related to the number of grid points :math:`n_i` and the grid length
    :math:`l_i` by

    .. math::

       l_i = h_i (n_i - 1)

    Therefore, only two of the following three properties are needed.  When all
    three are provided, the :func:`spacings` will be inferred from the 
    :func:`counts` and :func:`lengths`.

    * ``counts``:  the number of grid points in each direction; see
      :func:`counts` for more information.
    * ``spacings``:  the spacing of grid points in each direction; see
      :func:`spacings` for more information.
    * ``lengths``:  the span of the grid in each dimension; see :func:`lengths`
      for more information.

    The following properties are read-only and cannot be set:

    * ``levels``:  the number of multigrid levels in the calculation; see
      :func:`levels` for more information.

    The number of levels :math:`p` is a constant for the entire domain (i.e.,
    it doesn't vary by grid direction.  The number of levels is related to the
    number of grid points :math:`n_i` in the direction :math:`i` by the formula

    .. math::

       n_i = c \\, 2^{p} + 1

    where :math:`c` is a non-zero integer.  The value of :math:`p` is chosen as
    the smallest that satisfies the formula above for all :math:`n_i`.
    Calculations become more efficient for larger :math:`p` so APBS will adjust
    the numbers of grid points :math:`n_i` *downwards* to ensure that :math:`p`
    is equal to or greater than :const:`MIN_LEVEL`, likely resulting in lower
    grid resolution (and accuracy).

    The most common values for :math:`n_i` are 65, 97, 129, and 161 (they can
    be different in each direction); these are all compatible with
    :math:`p = 4`.

class Focus(InputFile):
    """Parameters specific to a focused-grid finite-difference polar solvation
    Poisson-Boltzmann calculation.

    Focusing provides automatically configured finite difference
    Poisson-Boltzmann calculations.

    This multigrid calculation automatically sets up and performs a string of
    single-point PBE calculations to "focus" on a region of interest
    (binding site, etc.) in a system. It is basically an automated way to set
    parameters in :class:`Manual`, allowing for (hopefully) easier use. Most
    users should use this :class:`Focus` rather than :class:`Manual`.

    Focusing is a method for solving the Poisson-Boltzmann equation in a finite
    difference setting. Some of the earliest references to this method are from
    Gilson and Honig [#Gilson]_. The method starts by solving the equation on a
    coarse grid (i.e., few grid points) with large dimensions (i.e., grid
    lengths). The solution on this coarse grid is then used to set the
    Dirichlet boundary condition values for a smaller problem domain -- and
    therefore a finer grid -- surrounding the region of interest. The finer
    grid spacing in the smaller problem domain often provides greater accuracy
    in the solution.

    .. note::

       During focusing calculations, you may encounter the message ``WARNING!
       Unusually large potential values detected on the focusing boundary!``
       for some highly charged systems based on location of the focusing
       boundary. First, you should determine if you received any other warning
       or error messages as part of this calculation, particularly those
       referring to exceeded number of iterations or error tolerance. Next, you
       should check if the calculation converged to a reasonable answer. In
       particular, you should check sensitivity to the grid spacing by making
       small changes to the grid lengths and see if the changes in energies are
       correspondingly small. If so, then this warning can be safely ignored.

          the boundary is set to the values computed by a previous (usually
          lower-resolution) PB calculation with alias :c:var:`alias`. All of the
