.. _gridpts:

gridpts
=======

.. todo::  This command has not yet been ported to the *new APBS syntax* (see :ref:`new_input_format`).

Specify the number of gridpoints in each cartesian dimension.

.. code-block:: bash
   
   gridpts {pts}

where ``pts`` is a integer number indicating the number of grid points.

.. todo::
   
   The PB-(S)AM ``gridpts`` keyword should not exist; it's duplicative of the existing :ref:`dime` keyword!
