.. module:: apbs

The :program:`apbs` command provides a command-line interface to APBS's functionality.
It is built on classes and functions in the :mod:`apbs` module.
The API (application programming interface) of :mod:`apbs` is documented here for developers who might want to directly use the APBS code.

.. Note::

   The API is still changing and there is currently no guarantee that
   it will remain stable between minor releases.
